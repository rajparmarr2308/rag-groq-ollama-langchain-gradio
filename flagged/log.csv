Hi tell me about your knowledge,"Based on the provided document, I can share the following information:

1. Chandrayaan 3 is a follow-on mission by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) with the main objective of landing a lander and rover in the highlands near the south pole of the Moon. It aims to demonstrate end-to-end landing and roving capabilities, make scientific measurements on the lunar surface and from orbit, and comprises a lander/rover and a propulsion module.
2. The lander/rover is similar to the Vikram rover on Chandrayaan 2, but with improvements to ensure a safe landing. The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration and will remain in lunar orbit while acting as a communications relay satellite.
3. Lander payloads include Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE), Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA), Langmuir Probe (LP), and a passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA for lunar laser ranging studies.
4. Rover payloads consist of Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of the landing site.
5. Chandrayaan 1 was an ISRO mission from 2008-2010 designed to orbit the Moon for two years, upgrading and testing India's technological capabilities in space and returning scientific information on the lunar surface.
6. Chandrayaan 2 was launched in July 2019 with the primary objective of demonstrating the ability to soft-land on the lunar surface and operate a robotic rover. The lander, however, crashed during descent, while the orbiter remains operational.
7. Objectives of Chandrayaan 3 include demonstrating a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, exploring the moon's surface with a rover, and conducting in-situ scientific experiments.

when chandrayan landed on moon surface,"According to the document, Chandrayan 3, a mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), successfully landed on the surface of the Moon on August 23, 2023. The rover, named ""Ch -3 Rover"", was ramped down from the Lander and India took a walk on the Moon. This landing marks a significant milestone for India's space program as it is the first time an Indian-made spacecraft has landed on the Moon's surface.
